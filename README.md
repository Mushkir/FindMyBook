# E-Book Web Application

A comprehensive E-Book web-based application has been developed using ASP.NET with the MVC architecture as a final year coursework project for a Software Engineering degree. This application is designed to streamline the process of managing book orders, featuring functionalities such as adding books to the cart, viewing the cart, confirming orders, making payments, and providing feedback. The system incorporates two primary roles: Admin and Customer. The Admin role includes managing book details, customer information, author details, publication information, order tracking, and handling cart details. The Customer role enables users to create accounts, search for books, add books to the cart, place orders, make payments, and submit feedback.
